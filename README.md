This repository contains a simple C program that demonstrates integer overflow. The program initializes an integer variable x to 10. Then, it creates an integer pointer ptr that points to the memory location of x. The value of x is updated through the pointer, and the program prints the new value of x. Integer overflow occurs when an arithmetic operation results in a value larger than the maximum representable value for the integer type. This can lead to unexpected results, and may even cause the program to crash.
